# Data-Visualization-assignment

<p>Here , the visualization introduced a new bar chart that plotted Number of Crime cases VS the
Category of Crime namely, ‘Disappearances’, ’Terrorism_Fatalities’, ’Terrorism_injuries’,
’Organised_Conflicts’, ’Violent_Conflicts’, and ‘Homicide’. This bar chart was included
so that we can see which category of crime is causing the most number of cases in a
particular country. Furthermore, for the first map visualization, It was decided to use it as a
filter for this new bar chart only. So when any country is clicked on the map, the bar
chart will show the trend of the number of crime cases for different types of crimes in
that country. </p>
<p>
The third graph displayed the line chart that plotted crime_cases
VS Country. Since the data set has data for 160 countries, when the line chart was plotted, it became very
messy as we had multiple lines going across the chart. Therefore, we replaced it with
‘region’ to have a clearer view and to be able to analyse the trend as the regions are
limited. </p>
<p>
For the last visualization, we decided to replace it with a line chart and plotted
‘Religious_Freedom’ VS mean number of ‘Crime_Cases’. The purpose of this
visualization was to analyse if there are any religions affecting the number of crimes in
the world. </p>
